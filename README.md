We have 5 different files: charts.py, q1_data.py, q2_data.py, q3_data.py and testing.py.
Charts.py imports all 3 datasets files to make charts.


### Instruction
All modules will be installed as user click run. 

Question 1: User can use slider to set the range of data on the graph.

Question 2: There are two choices on the bar chart that user can select "Most dangerous" and "Safest."
            Each will show the top 5 most dangerous states or the safest states.

Question 3: We provided a search bar that user can type an year in the range from 2015 to 2021.
            In accordance with user's input, it will show the pie chart which shows proportion of top five states of each,                                                          including proprtion of sum of the other states.
